		<h3>Who are the biggest food producers?</h3>
		<p>Food is a fundamental economic product, but only a handful of countries actually excel at food production.(Ross 2019)</p>
		<p>Food Balance dataset from FAO presents a comprehensive picture of the food supply chain of a country during 1961-2017. An overall investigation reveals that <big class="bolded">China, India, United States, Brazil and Russia</big> have long been the top food producers in the world.</p>
		<p>The United States had been a leader in food markets until 1980s, China started out-producing the US. Later in 1997 and 2007, India and Brazil's food production quantity outran US for the first time.</p>
		<p>Comparing to the top four countries, Russia has a relative low but steady production quantity through the years, partially because of its harsh northern climate but extremely abundance in land.</p>
		<p>Scroll down to see the map showing the <big class="bolded">changes of total production quantity</big> for the top 5 food producers. Slide the bar to view the changes through time!</p>

		<h3>Are they the countries feeding the world?</h3>
		<p>Although China and India are absolute leaderships in the amounts of production quantity, these two countries end up consuming most of their own products. This makes sense since China and India have the world's largest populations by a wide margin.(Ross 2019)</p>
		<p>On the other hand, the exportation pattern presents a quite different landscape. United States has long been the world's largest food exporter. Countries who are <big class="bolded">low in population, relative rich in land, advanced in agricultural technologies</big> stand out in the exportation quantity.</p>
		<p>Brazil exports 27% of its total production, and has become second largest exporter in the world. France, Russia, Germany, Canada, and Netherlands follow.
		China, with high population, exports just more than India.</p>
		<p>Scroll down to see the diagram comparing patterns of exportation(top chord chart) and domestic food consumption(bottom chord chart) based on 2017 dataset(unit: 1000 tonn). 
		The width of each flow represents the amount ratio of the total 9 countries, they are sorted from smallest(left) to largest(right).</p>

		<h3>How can we produce enough food for future?</h3>
		<p>There will be more than 9 billion people in 30 years. To feed those who are currently hungry and the additional 2 billion plus people who will live on the planet by 2050, our best projections are that crop production will need to increase between 60 and 100 percent.</p>
		<p>However, climate change will reshape the worldâ€™s agricultural landscape. Colder climates will become more favorable to agriculture, but many current agriculture powerhouses will see significant declines in yield.
		To safeguard against these changes, farmers will need to both modernize agricultural methods and diversify their fields.</p>
		<p>We are striving in a challenging time. Because the future, is in our hands.</p>
