		<h3>Who are the biggest food producers?</h3>
		<p>Food is a fundamental economic product, but only a handful of countries actually excel at food production. Most agricultural commodities require a lot of land, which only the largest countries have in abundance.(Ross 2019)</p>
		<p>Food Balance dataset from FAO presents a comprehensive picture of the food supply chain (import, production and export quantities) of a country during 1961-2017. An overall investigation reveals that <big id="bolded">China, India, United States, Brazil and Russia</big> have long been the top food producers in the world.</p>
		<p>The United States had been a leader in food markets until 1980s, China started out-producing the US. Later in 1997 and 2007, India and Brazil's food production quantity outran US for the first time.</p>
		<p>Comparing to the top four countries, Russia has a relative low production quantity partially because of its harsh northern climate.</p>

			<p>The United States has long been the world's largest food exporter. China and India also end up consuming much more of their own products. This makes sense since China and India have the world's largest populations by a wide margin.(Ross 2019)</p>
