		<h3>Who are the biggest food producers?</h3>
		<p>Food is a fundamental economic product, but only a handful of countries actually excel at food production. Most agricultural commodities require a lot of land, which only the largest countries have in abundance.(Ross 2019)</p>
		<p>Food Balance dataset from FAO presents a comprehensive picture of the food supply chain (import, production and export quantities) of a country during 1961-2017. An overall investigation reveals that <big id="bolded">China, India, United States, Brazil and Russia</big> have long been the top food producers in the world.</p>
		<p>The United States had been a leader in food markets until 1980s, China started out-producing the US. Later in 1997 and 2007, India and Brazil's food production quantity outran US for the first time.</p>
		<p>Comparing to the top four countries, Russia has a relative low but steady production quantity through the years, partially because of its harsh northern climate.</p>
		<p>Scroll down to see the map showing the <big class="bolded">changes of total production quantity</big> from 1967-2017.</p>

		<h3>Are they the countries that are feeding the world?</h3>
		<p>Although China and India are absolute leaderships in the amounts of production quantity, these two countries end up consuming much more of their own products. This makes sense since China and India have the world's largest populations by a wide margin.(Ross 2019)</p>
		<p>On the other hand, the exportation pattern presents a quite different landscape. United States has long been the world's largest food exporter. Countries who are <big class="bolded">low in population, relative rich in land, advanced in agricultural technologies</big> stand out in the exportation quantity.</p>
		<p>Brazil exports 27% of its total production, and has become second largest exporter in the world. France, Russia, Germany, Canada, and Netherlands follow.
		China, with high population, exports just more than India.</p>
